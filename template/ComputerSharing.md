The user will get an email and will have to accept the shared computer.

If someone shares a computer with you, you'll see the shared computer on the [Other User's Computers](https://www.triggercmd.com/user/computer/otherlist) page.  

To remove a computer that someone has shared with you, delete it from the [Other User's Computers](https://www.triggercmd.com/user/computer/otherlist) page.  

To stop sharing one of your computers, click the Share button again and click delete the other user from the list of people you've shared it with.
