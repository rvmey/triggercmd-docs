# IFTTT

To use the TRIGGERcmd IFTTT integration, click [here](https://ifttt.com/trigger_cmd) and click **Connect**.

IFTTT means, "If THIS, then THAT," in otherwords if THIS happens, do THAT.  

You can add TRIGGERcmd to your applet's THIS or THAT slot:
- Use the "THIS" slot to run an applet when you trigger a command.
- Use the "THAT" slot to trigger a command when your applet runs.  

Here's a Youtube [video showing how to use it](https://youtu.be/NO6OASpij1c).
