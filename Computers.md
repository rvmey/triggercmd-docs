## Add a computer

To add your computer to your TRIGGERcmd account, you'll need to install a TRIGGERcmd agent on it.  

The agent installer will ask your for a **token** to log it in.  

Copy the token from the [instructions page](https://www.triggercmd.com/user/computer/create) and paste it into the token prompt.
