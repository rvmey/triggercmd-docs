## Activate the **TRIGGERcmd Smart Home** Alexa skill

Click [here](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/0000002be4521c02) for a direct link to the TRIGGERcmd Smart Home page, but you can't activate the action from there.  

Instead, you have to find it in the Home app under Assistant settings, Home control.

## Alternative Google Assistant actions

For most use-cases, the **TRIGGERcmd Smart Home** Alexa skill works best, but there are some that can only be accomplished using one of the conversational Alexa actions.  For example, the **Voice Reply** field only works with conversational actions.

The conversational actions do not create a virtual switch for each command like the Smart Home skill does, so Alexa doesn't have a list of what you might say ahead of time, which make it less likely Alexa will successfully match your spoken words to your commands.
