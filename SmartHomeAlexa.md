You should now have a virtual switch called "calculator" so you can say, "Alexa, turn on calculator" to run calculator on your computer.

Click [here](./SmartHomeSwitches.md) for more detail about these virtual switches.

This [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jm_s9sTZXw) shows how it works.

To see a list of sentences that will run your commands via the TRIGGERcmd Smart Home skill, see the [Smart Home Voice Commands](https://www.triggercmd.com/user/command/shprintlist) page.

## Trigger Alexa Routines

When you enable the **TRIGGERcmd Smart Home** Alexa skill, you can also create Alexa Routines that run when your TRIGGERcmd command runs.  

In the Alexa app, create a new Routine and select **Smart Home** under **When this happens** and you'll see a list of your TRIGGERcmd virtual switches.  

This [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrqj-OwDpGE) shows how it works.

## Alternative Alexa skills

For most use-cases, the **TRIGGERcmd Smart Home** Alexa skill works best, but there are some that can only be accomplished using one of the conversational Alexa skills.  For example, the **Voice Reply** field only works with conversational skills.

The conversational skills do not create a virtual switch for each command like the Smart Home skill does, so Alexa doesn't have a list of what you might say ahead of time, which makes it less likely your spoken words will match your commands.
