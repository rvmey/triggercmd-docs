# Quick Start

As a new user, these are the first steps you should take to get started:

* Create a TRIGGERcmd account [here](https://www.triggercmd.com/user/auth/signup).
* Install a TRIGGERcmd agent on your computer.  Scroll to the bottom of [this page](https://www.triggercmd.com/user/auth/signup) to find the download links.  
* When the agent installer prompts you for a token, copy it from the [Instructions page](https://www.triggercmd.com/user/computer/create) and paste it into the token prompt.  
* In your TRIGGERcmd account, click on your computer, then click the green Trigger button to run one of the built-in commands.

Success!  Now you're ready to add your own commmands to run remotely.
